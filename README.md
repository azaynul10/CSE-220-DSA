# 🌟 CSE-220 Data Structures Repository 🌟

Welcome to my repository for the CSE-220 Data Structures course at BRAC University! This repo contains assignments and course materials covering fundamental data structures and algorithms. Get ready to dive into the exciting world of Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Sorting Algorithms, Recursion, Trees, Heaps, and Graphs!

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **Arrays** - Unleash the power of indexing and random access! 
   
   

2. **Linked Lists** - Chain nodes together for dynamic memory allocation! 
   

3. **Stacks** - Last in, first out! Perfect for function calls and undo operations. 
   

4. **Queues** - First in, first out! Line up for breadth-first search and scheduling tasks. 
   

5. **Sorting Algorithms** - Put everything in its place with bubble sort, insertion sort, and more! 
   

6. **Recursion** - Solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems! 
   

7. **Trees** - Traverse hierarchical structures with ease using binary trees and BSTs!
